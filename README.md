# Minimal LL Custom Map
This is a minimal project with just enough to get the custom map to run in Lorn's Lure and upload to steam workshop, plus a few prefabs that would be necessary for almost every map.

I recommend using Rubeki's [template map](https://github.com/circlesandlines/LLCustomMapTemplate) along side this for reference/use of not-so-bare-boned assets.
